3. In the Create Dataset page's **Name** field, provide a name for the dataset table created from the file. 

4. (Optional) If youâ€™re uploading a CSV or TXT file, then in the Separated By, Thousand Separator, and Decimal Separator fields, confirm or change the default delimiters. To specify a custom delimiter, choose Custom in the Separated By field and enter the character you want to use as the delimiter. In the CSV or TXT file, a custom delimiter must be one character. The following example uses a pipe (|) as a delimiter: Year|Product|Revenue|Quantity|Target Revenue| Target Quantity.
